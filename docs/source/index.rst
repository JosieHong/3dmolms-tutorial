Welcome to 3DMolMS Documentation
===============================

3D Molecular Network for Mass Spectra Prediction (3DMolMS) is a deep neural network model to predict the MS/MS spectra of compounds from their 3D conformations. It can be used to:

* Predict MS/MS spectra for small molecules
* Generate reference libraries of small molecule MS/MS spectra for identification
* Predict molecular properties like retention time (RT) and collision cross section (CCS)
* Pretrain models on molecular datasets
